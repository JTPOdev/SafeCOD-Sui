## 🛡️ About SafeCOD

**SafeCOD** is a blockchain-powered escrow platform designed to solve the "Bogus Buyer" epidemic in the Philippines.

### The Problem
In the Philippines, **Cash-on-Delivery (COD)** is the standard payment method due to low banking penetration. However, sellers suffer massive losses when:
- Buyers refuse delivery upon arrival
- Buyers "ghost" riders and don't show up
- Perishable goods spoil due to failed deliveries

### Our Solution
SafeCOD uses **Sui blockchain escrow** to protect both buyers and sellers:

1. **Buyer deposits SUI** to escrow when ordering
2. **Seller ships** knowing payment is guaranteed
3. **Rider delivers** the package
4. **Buyer confirms receipt** → funds released to seller

No more bogus buyers. No more wasted products. **100% payment protection.**
